# <center>Fuzzy Logic Temperature Controller</center>

### Overview

**In this project, we use the capabilities of fuzzy logic to create a room temperature controller. The controller receives two inputs: the room's current temperature and the rate of temperature change. The controller's output is the air conditioning system's adjustment value. We can manage real-world inputs and make the necessary modifications to maintain a comfortable temperature using the fuzzy logic-based technique.**


### Fuzzy Logic Concepts

**It is necessary to understand certain fundamental notions of fuzzy logic in order to comprehend the operation of the temperature controller. We look at things like fuzzy sets, fuzzy rules, fuzzy inference systems, and defuzzification techniques. The foundation for creating a reliable fuzzy temperature controller is provided by these ideas.**

### Problem Context

**We connect each notion in the fuzzy logic discussion to the issue of creating a temperature controller. This makes sure that the concepts are explained in a way that is relevant to the issue at hand. We obtain a greater comprehension of fuzzy logic and its useful applications by comprehending how each notion connects to the temperature controller.**

### Python Implementation

**Along with the required libraries and code snippets, we offer a fuzzy temperature controller solution in Python. In order to provide clear results, the implementation shows how to construct fuzzy variables, membership functions, fuzzy rules, and conduct defuzzification. To see the fuzzy logic in action, you can easily execute the code in JupyterLab or any other Python environment.**
